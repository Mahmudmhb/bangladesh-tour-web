* On a self-guided tour, you'll have everything you need at your fingertips courtesy of detailed trip notes, but with the added freedom to pick and choose what you want to do and when. You could be hiking and trekking, or road-tripping, or city-hopping, all at your own pace with the luxury of knowing a tour operator will have your back whenever you need assistance or advice!

*For families travelling with children. Kids have their own schedule and travelling as part of a tour group doesn't always align with that. A self-guided tour will give the whole family plenty of options and things to do, without the pressure of having to stick to someone else's schedule. 

* For groups of friends who want to enjoy each others company. Travelling with friends is fun, and a self-guided tour will take the hassle of planning away, leaving all of you free to do what you do best: enjoy each other's company! 

* Tours are great, but on vacation, sometimes it's just nice to wake-up when you want and be free to make your own decisions. On a self-guided vacation, you get the perks of a multi-day group tour: an expertly planned itinerary but with more flexibility to pick and choose what you want, spend more time somewhere, and never wory about keeping up with the tour group.  

*  When booking a travel experience, you can't plan for everything, and sometimes things are just not in our control. The unexpected always has a way of happening, and that's exactly what we hope for when travelling, a break from the mundane. For those times when things really get out of hand, even on a self-guided tour, you can rest easy knowing that operator support is just a phone call away. 

* Figuring out train schedules and bus schedules on vacation is a hassle and time-consuming. This is why tours usually come with pre-booked transportation. Don't worry though, you'll get all the comfort of detailed information on transport routes, bus and train times on a self-guided tour as well - so you can always be in the right place at the right time!
